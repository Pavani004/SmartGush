# IoT-Driven Smart Drainage Maintenance app: Real-Time Monitoring, Predictive Analytics, and Location-Based Alerts for Urban Flood Management 

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the real-time monitoring and maintenance of urban drainage systems using IoT devices, predictive analytics, and location-based alert mechanisms. The goal is to mitigate flooding, reduce system downtime, and efficiently handle maintenance requests. The system integrates hardware (sensors, NodeMCU, GSM modules) with software (an Android app, Blynk for alerts, Firebase database) to streamline communication between users, administrators, and maintenance teams. Predictive analysis is implemented using RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) to forecast defective or blocked drainage points.

##Motivation

Urban flooding, drainage blockages, and delayed response to drainage maintenance are growing concerns, especially during heavy rainfall. Traditional methods of maintenance rely on manual checks or delayed reporting, leading to significant infrastructural damage. By automating drainage monitoring and maintenance requests, this system aims to provide a proactive solution, minimizing the risk of flooding and enhancing the effectiveness of drainage maintenance.

## Hardware Components

- **NodeMCU (ESP8266)**: Acts as the central controller, connecting various sensors and sending data over WiFi. 
- **Sensors**: Water level, Light, Temperature, gas sensors are used
- **GSM Module**: Used for sending alerts via SMS in case of network failure or for offline alerting.
- **Blynk Integration**: For real-time monitoring and pushing alerts to the admin dashboard and app.
-  **GPS Module**: For precise geolocation of the drainage points if more detailed tracking is required.

## Software Components

1 **Android App**: The app contains admin dashboard and user interface for reporting with notifications using FCM
2 **IoT Platform (Blynk)**: Collects data from sensors and sends real-time alerts to the Android app
3 **Firebase Database**: Stores user complaints, drainage locations, sensor readings, and issue history. Manhole codes are mapped to specific geographic coordinates to simplify operations.
4 **Predictive Analytics (RNN)** : The model aims to reduce maintenance response times by forecasting potential failures.

## Key Features

1 **Real-Time Monitoring**: IoT sensors continuously monitor manholes for water level, flow rates, and gas accumulation. Data is sent to the admin dashboard for real-time oversight.
2 **Alert System (Online/Offline)**: Online: Notifications are sent via Blynk and FCM to the admin’s Android app when issues are detected.
Offline: In case of network failure, the system uses GSM to send SMS alerts to pre-defined numbers.
3 **location-Based Reporting**: The user's location is automatically captured using the Android app’s
4 **Predictive Maintenance** : Using RNN models built with TensorFlow, the system predicts future blockages or drainage failures by analyzing historical sensor data and identifying patterns. This enables proactive rather than reactive maintenance.
5 **Task Assignment and Tracking** : The admin can assign maintenance tasks to specific teams, track the progress of tasks, and close resolved issues in the system. The system ensures that every complaint is addressed in a timely manner.

## Challenges

1 **Real-Time Data Processing**: Collecting, processing, and sending data from multiple manholes in real-time is a technical challenge that requires robust network infrastructure and IoT devices.
2 **Predictive Analysis Accuracy**: Ensuring that the predictive models generate reliable and accurate forecasts requires large datasets and consistent training of the models.
3 **Integration with Legacy Systems**: Incorporating the system with existing drainage management systems can be challenging if legacy infrastructure is involved.

## Benefits

1 **Reduced Flooding Risk**: Real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance reduce the likelihood of drainage blockages and urban flooding.
2 **Proactive Maintenance**: Predictive analytics prevent potential issues before they escalate, reducing system downtime and repair costs.
3 **Efficient Resource Allocation**: The admin dashboard provides all the necessary information for the maintenance team, enabling better task prioritization and resource management.
4 **Better Citizen Engagement** : Users can report drainage issues quickly, and the system provides immediate feedback and status updates.
5 **Scalability** : The system can easily be scaled to monitor more manholes and expanded to include additional features, such as more advanced analytics or integration with city-wide infrastructure systems.

## Future Enhancements

1 **Integration with Other City Services**: The system can be integrated with other urban services such as waste management and public transportation to create a comprehensive smart city platform.
2 **Advanced Data Analytics**: As more data is collected, more sophisticated machine learning models can be developed to predict a wider range of potential issues, including the impact of weather conditions on drainage performance.
3 **Automated Issue Resolution**: Future iterations of the system may include robotic or automated tools to fix minor blockages without human intervention.
